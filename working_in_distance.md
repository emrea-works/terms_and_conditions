#Working Conditions
## **I'm sure I would be most effective if**

\- The video meetings **would NOT go more than 55 minutes at once;** hence we can reschedule another meeting if we need to take it longer. Online working in real-time collaboration is different condition.

\- The video meetings include people who is coming for the first time, **either they turn their cam ON or every one can keep their cams off;** hence this isn't important among the old members. 

\- I will be free not to join to the video meetings if there will be someone joining **who never talks** in the group chats. 

\- I will be free to leave the project anytime **IF my questions won't be replied in 24 hours** in any channel, hence I will remind everyone about my questions in repeat. 

\- I will hear or read a very quick summary **about the content and the participants** of the meeting before we get into. 

## **I will be very helpful, tireless and most effective in a team while...**

\- All the team members **accept to join to the meeting** that will attend the roles on the project before starting working on it.

\- The team members accept to join a standup meeting (5\~10mins) **"almost" everyday;** could have excuses of course.

\- The team members **follow a plan board, or basically will accept to have an instruction** of usage a plan board and how to work in a collaboration.

\- All the team members accept that **the latest decisions will be made by only the project manager**.
